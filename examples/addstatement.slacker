#The add statement works in an interesting way.
#When using the add statement the first variable to be added will be set to the output of the code executed
#For example..

ADD a,b

#Executing ADD a,b will give 3. Now the variable a is equal to the number 3.
#To prove this the next piece of code will be executed that will simply print the variable a.

ADD a,zero

#The same applies to MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, and SUBTRACT
